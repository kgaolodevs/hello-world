Hello world repository 

I am an aspiring Software Engineer, with a key interest in the full-stack Web Development environment. The first programming language I taught myself was JavaScript, even though it has somewhat of a reputation for being a bit obscure, I somehow enjoy writing it. Outside of tech, I am a music producer & composer, graphic designer as well as a CFD trader.
